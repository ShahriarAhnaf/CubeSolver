# SelfSolvingCube
A program that will be able to solve a random rubix cube

Using Rubix Cube notation implementation

## Project revamped after a long hiatus! 
- going to be cleaning up first and understanding project
- 

## How to run and build 
```
    cd Rubix 
    make run 
```
- uses rubix cube algorithm notation such as U,F,D,B etc. lowercase of the letter is the normal move, while upper case is prime i.e F is F prime and f is normal f.

## Future Improvements
- Add graphical engine using Metal/OpenGL
- Generalize to bigger cubes?
- Implement machine learning for a trained algorithm
