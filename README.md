# SelfSolvingCube
A program that will be able to solve a random rubix cube

Using Rubix Cube notation implementation

## Project revamped after a long hiatus! 
- New Things!! Using AI for a lot of implementation since I took a nice time to design a bunch of the architecture for how this should go down.
- 

- uses rubix cube algorithm notation such as U,F,D,B etc. lowercase of the letter is the normal move, while upper case is prime i.e F is F prime and f is normal f.

## Future Improvements
- Add graphical engine using Metal/OpenGL
- Generalize to bigger cubes?
- Implement machine learning for a trained algorithm
