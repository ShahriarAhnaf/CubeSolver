Using Rubix Cube notation implementation

## Project revamped after a long hiatus! 
- going to be cleaning up first and understanding project
- 

## How to run and build 
```make ```

## Future Improvements
- Add graphical engine using Metal/OpenGL
- Generalize to bigger cubes?
- Implement machine learning for a trained algorithm
