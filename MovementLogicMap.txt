face movement logic!

middle faces are looked at with the white on top, while white and yellow faces are looked at with blue on top. 
movements have two versions labeled with the color or color' ie( MoveWhite, moveWhite'). 

since the faces are just number iusing if statements is sufficient to see which faces affect which when the mmovement of the cube is done in any of the faces

when top(1) moves , 2 unaffected, 3 4 5 6 faces are affected in the top row(array row 1), the rows are shifted over incrementally between 3-6

when bottom(2) moves , 1 unaffected, 3 4 5 6 faces are affected in the bottom row(array row 3), the rows are shifted over incrementally between 3-6

when middle 3-6 moves ( column 3 = left, column 1 = right)z
-  for 3(5 unaffected),  4 6 faces are affected on the side columns(array colum 3 and  1),  1 2 top row are affected(array row 1). 
-  for 5(3 unaffected),  4 6 faces are affected on the side columns(array colum 1 and  3),  1 2 bottom row are affected(array row 3). 
-  for 4(6 unaffected),  3 5 faces are affected on the side columns(array colum 1 and  3),  1 2 side columns are affected(array column 3 and 1).
-  for 6(4 unaffected),  3 5 faces are affected on the side columns(array colum 3 and  1),  1 2 top row are affected(array column 1 and 3).
